### The vaping industry will increase its popularity, as the customers demand a better vaping experience 


Recent years have seen the rapid growth of E-cigarettes and vaping devices.

With a brand-new year on the horizon, let me invite you to take a glimpse of where the vaping industry will go for 2019.

Dr. Osita Onugha, director of thoracic surgery research at the John Wayne Cancer Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in California, welcomes the additional FDA scrutiny to help reduce the public health risks of e-cigarettes.
He said, “If the FDA finds that companies are using illegal or illicit chemicals in e-cigarettes, it could potentially lead to a ban on e-cigarettes from certain companies.”

“Overall, this would likely force companies to harbor less toxic chemicals in their e-cigarettes, which would ultimately drive its use. I am optimistic that the more the public pays attention to the chemicals in e-cigarettes, the less likely people would want to place these chemicals in their body,” Onugha said.

With regards to vaping regulations, more and more researches about vaping are indicating that the devices of vaping are relatively safer and more effective than cigarettes as smoking cessation tools. The market leaders hope that more countries will recognize the devices as harm reduction tools and relax their laws accordingly.

Above all, towards vaping, people still harbor the optimism and the anxiety that goes with it in the coming 2019.

#### Innovative Technology 

Look at the smartphones and tablets we use now compared to cell phones of a decade ago. The innovative technology that the upgrades of smartphones have utilized is far exceeding our imagination and beyond. The vaping industry will follow suit. In 2019, you are expected to see a vape with more customization, a longer battery life, digital displays, ergonomic design, and better charging.

- A greater variety of flexible vaping kits to work with almost every flavor available
- Utilize battery packs instead of the current lithium-ion batteries

As known to all, the essence of the whole vaping device lies in the magnetic pod system that could prevent leaks and spills. More and more pod products， such as the NJOY Ace pods, [adopt the new vaping technology from FEELM](http://www.feelmtech.com/) that combines a metal film with a ceramic conductor, which is regarded as a breakthrough in Material and Structural Science and improves the flavor, leak-proof and vaporizing efficiency to another level. In 2019, It will not be so much surprising to find more vaping devices that adopts the FEELM technology being traded in the global market.
